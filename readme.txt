All Polldaddy polls are fully customizable, you can set a close date for your poll, create multiple choice polls, choose whether to display the results or keep them private. You can also create your own custom style for your poll. You can even embed the polls you create on other websites. You can collect unlimited votes and create unlimited polls.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have multiple authors on my blog?  What happens? =

Each author that wants to create polls will need his or her own Polldaddy.com account.

= But, as an Administrator, can I edit my Authors' polls =

Yes. You'll be able to edit the polls they create from your blog.  (You won't be able to edit any of their non-blog, personal polls they create through Polldaddy.com.)

= Neat! Um... can my Authors edit MY blog polls? =

Nope.  The permissions are the same as for posts.  So Editors and Administrators can edit anyone's polls for that blog.  Authors can only edit their own.

= Where are my ratings? =

Check your theme's footer.php calls wp_footer. The rating javascript is loaded on this action. 

More info here - http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Plugin_API_Hooks

= I cannot access my ratings settings, I am getting a "Sorry! There was an error creating your rating widget. Please contact Polldaddy support to fix this." message. =

You need to select the synchronize ratings account in the Options menu to make sure the ratings API key is valid.

= When I try to use a rating on a page, I get a PHP warning about the post title. =

Your rating uses the filter 'wp_title' by default when retrieving the post title, you may need to remove this in the Polls & Ratings settings to allow ratings to work with your theme.

= Why is a poll loading in the footer of my main page? =

Your theme is getting the post content, without necessarily showing it. If the post has a poll, the poll javascript is loaded in the footer. To fix this, you need to enable the 'Load Shortcodes Inline' setting in the Polls & Ratings settings. This will load the poll shortcode inline and will only load the poll if the content of the post is actually displayed.
